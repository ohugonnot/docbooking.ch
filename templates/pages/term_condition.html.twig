									<h3>General</h3>
									<p> The Site is owned and operated by MEDoctor Inc., a Delaware professional corporation (the “Company”). The Company reserves the right to revise or remove any part of the Terms in its sole discretion at any time and without prior notice to you by updating this posting. You thus should visit this page periodically for changes. This Site is continually under development and changes to this Site may be made at any time. Any changes to the Terms are effective upon posting to this Site. If you disagree with the Terms, your sole remedy is to discontinue your use of this Site. Your continued use after a change has been posted constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="terms-text">
									<h3>Consultative Services</h3>
									<p> The purpose of the service provided through the Site is to give physicians and Members access to additional information which they may or may not choose to utilize in planning medical care. It is not a substitute for primary care and no physician-patient relationship is created by use of this Site. The service provided through the Site varies by condition and by state of residence of the patient, with special emphasis on providing a second opinion (sometimes referred to as a consulting opinion or an expert opinion) regarding diagnosis and treatment options or providing lists of local medical professionals who may be accepting new patients.</p>
									<p> The service is limited. In some cases the online nature of the service will make it difficult to verify a diagnosis (particularly with conditions that rely heavily on direct physician-patient interaction for accurate diagnosis). In those cases, the service provided through the Site will focus on the assessment or recommendation of treatment options. The decision to focus on diagnosis, treatment recommendation, or both rests with the consulting physician. </p>
									<p> The service provided through this Site differs from the diagnostic services typically provided by a physician. The medical professionals providing services through this Site will not have the benefit of information that would be obtained by examining you in person and observing your physical condition. Therefore, the medical professional providing services through this Site may not be aware of facts or information that would affect his or her opinion of your diagnosis. To reduce the risk to you of this limitation, the Company strongly encourages you to discuss the second opinion with your physician. By deciding to engage the services of this Site, you acknowledge and agree that you are aware of this limitation and agree to assume the risk of this limitation. Furthermore, you agree and accept that:
the diagnosis you will receive is limited and provisional;
the second opinion is not intended to replace a full medical evaluation or an in-person visit with a physician;
the medical professionals providing services through this Site do not have important information that is usually obtained through a physical examination; and
the absence of a physical examination may affect the medical professional’s ability to diagnose your condition, disease or injury.</p>
									<p> You also agree that the second opinion will not be used in any legal dispute including but not limited to litigation, arbitration, claim for disability benefits, claim for worker’s compensation and/or malpractice claims without the prior written consent of the Company. </p>
									<p> By requesting any service through the Site, you authorize us to collect your medical records on your behalf from any and all facilities that may have such records, store those records, and transmit them to the physician or physicians appropriate for your case.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="terms-text">
									<h3>Privacy</h3>
									<p> We are constantly seeking to improve the quality of care. If you have requested a consultative service, a physician referral, or another service, we may at any time review your case, your medical records from prior to and after your interaction with the Site, and any records created as a result of services received. We may request courtesy notices from your treating physician(s) and/or request additional medical records from them, including records pertaining to care you received after receiving the services. We may review these records for, among other purposes, reviewing the quality of service you received, reviewing the quality of service provided by the physicians and medical professionals treating you (including the physicians and medical professionals to whom you may have received a referral), to better understand the course of treatment for your condition(s) including information regarding outcomes and costs, and to improve treatments and recommendations for people with similar or different conditions. We will take care to minimize personally identifying information in this process. We may also use anonymous information gathered, including information from your medical records, to generate conclusions about the healthcare process, particular conditions, and other matters. We and our affiliated physicians and researchers may publish this anonymous information in journals, websites and other locations. However, we will not publish your name or any identifying information about you; we will use only anonymous data for any public purpose.</p>
									<p> We may be required by law to turn over certain information to law enforcement, or to respond to civil subpoenas and other legal process. By using this Site you acknowledge such risks. Additionally, we may voluntarily provide information to law enforcement or investigative agencies regarding suspected disruptive or destructive uses of the Site, such as “Denial-of-Service” attacks, credit card fraud, and other matters.</p>

									<p> You are not obligated to register with the Company in order to access this Site. However, certain services of this Site are available only to users who have registered with the Company or other persons affiliated with the Company who have been granted user IDs and passwords (“Secure Users”). If you are a Secure User, you agree to accurately maintain and update any information about yourself that you have provided to the Company.

									<h3>Site Security</h3>
									<p> Our Site requires users to create unique identifiers (such as a username and password) in order to log into many areas of the Site.

In addition, the Company takes steps to protect the user data we collect against unauthorized access. However, you should keep in mind that this Site and our services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.</p>
									<p> You must exercise caution, good sense and sound judgment in using this Site. You are prohibited from violating, or attempting to violate, the security of this Site. Any such violations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties against you.

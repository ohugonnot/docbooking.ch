									<h4>1. Purpose and Scope</h4>

									<p> Protecting your privacy and treating the personal data of all current, former and future users in accordance with the law is very important to us. We understand that by visiting and using our Site you may be entrusting us with personal information (“data”) and assure you that we take our duty to protect and safeguard this data very seriously. This privacy policy therefore explains the kind of data we collect, the purpose for which we collect it, how we process it, whom we may disclose it to and the security measures we have put in place to protect it. This privacy policy applies to all data we obtain through your use of our website. It does not apply to third-party websites, even if you access them via a link on the DocBooking Site. We have no influence on the content or privacy policy of any third-party websites and therefore cannot assume any responsibility for them. </p>
								</div>

								<div class="terms-text">
									<h4>2. Type of Data Collected</h4>

									<p> The following describes the types of personal and other information the Company may collect about you, and how the Company may use and maintain that information, including, but not limited to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li> 2.1 Registration.</li>
											<p>Before you can utilize certain services that we offer on the Site or otherwise, we may ask that you register with the Site and provide us with your email address, a password, your first and last name and other contact information and personal details. We request this information for identification purposes, to communicate with you regarding your account, and to facilitate the functioning of certain services. We may keep this information indefinitely.</p>
										<li> 2.2 Forms.</li>
											<p>To fully utilize the services we offer, you may be required to fill out forms that will contain personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, social security number, account information, employment, health status and other personal information relevant to your health insurance coverage, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
										<li> 2.3 Medical Records.</li>
											<p>In order for the medical professionals giving second opinions regarding your health, you may be required to provide us with past and current medical records, description of symptoms, a medical history and life-style descriptions.</p>
										<li> 2.4 Correspondence.</li>
											<p>If you correspond with us via email, we may gather in a file specific to you the information that you submit. We may keep this information indefinitely.</p>
										<li> 2.5 URL and IP addresses.</li>
											<p>Like many other websites, Company collects information about users’ utilization and navigation of our Site. This information helps us to design our Site to better suit our users’ needs. For example, our Site will track the URL that you visited before you came to our Site, the URL to which you next go and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
										<li> 2.6 Information Collected With Cookies.</li>
											<p>Like most major websites, the Company uses cookies on certain pages of our Site. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you’ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our Site, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently while visiting our Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site. If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as it would be if the cookie were enabled. The information that we collect with cookies allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site’s content, layout and services. However, we only use information collected with cookies on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you.</p>
									</ul>
								</div>

								<div class="terms-text">
									<h4>3. Purpose of Data Collected</h4>

									<p> We collect this data for the following primary purposes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li> 3.1 to comply with national and international legal and supervisory provisions as well as the DocBooking’s own internal guidelines,</li>
										<li> 3.2 to check the identity and suitability of users for certain Services,</li>
										<li> 3.3 to establish a basis for future information on the services and products offered by DocBooking and to improve their quality,</li>
										<li> 3.4 to facilitate technical administration, research and further development in connection with the DocBooking Site,</li>
										<li> 3.5 to use it for marketing and advertising measures (e.g. newsletters via e-mail, online advertising),</li>
										<li> 3.6 to analyse user behaviour and navigation while on the Site, </li>
										<li> 3.7 to facilitate client administration.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>

								<div class="terms-text">
									<h4>4. Security Measures</h4>

									<p> DocBooking takes appropriate technical and organisational security measures to ensure that personal data collected and stored in connection with your visit to our Site is protected against unauthorised access, misuse, loss and/or destruction. DocBooking takes both physical and electronic process-specific security measures, including firewalls, personal passwords, and encryption and authentication technologies. Our employees and service providers commissioned by us are bound by professional secrecy and must comply with all data protection provisions. Additionally, access to personal data is restricted to only those employees, contractors and third parties who require this access in order to assure the purpose of data processing and the provision of Services (need to know principle). Nevertheless, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that data transmitted via an open network like the Internet cannot be fully protected from third-party access. This may result in such data being disclosed or altered in content, or lead to technical errors in its transmission. In particular, data sent via the Internet (e.g. via a contact form on the website or an e-mail service) may leave the country – even where both sender and recipient are in the same country – and may be transmitted to and potentially stored in a third-party country in which data protection requirements may be laxer than in your country of residence. Where data is transmitted to DocBooking via the Internet, we cannot be held responsible for the protection of this data. We recommend avoiding the transmission of any strictly confidential information via open networks.</p>

								<div class="terms-text">
									<h4>5. Cookies and Web Analysis Tools</h4>

									<p> The Web site uses cookies. Cookies represent the data stored on user’s hardware, containing information on the user. If users reject a cookie, they can still use the Site. Cookies help us track and classify the interests of our users, to enhance their visit on our website. We also use internal web analysis tools for the purpose of website reporting. This involves the creation of pseudo-anonymised data and use of small text files stored on your computer. The information about your use of our Site generated by these cookies, such as (1) host name of the accessing computer (IP address), (2) type/version of browser used, (3) operating system (4) referrer URL, (5) date and time of server request, is not transmitted to any third-party servers. It is used exclusively for internal web analysis purposes.</p>
